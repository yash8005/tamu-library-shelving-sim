# tamu-library-shelving-sim
This project is a simulation of shelving books according to call numbers following the Library of Congress norms. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a sortable container of images representing books. The HTML Drag and Drop API is used for enabling drag and drop functionality, and jQuery is used for additional required purposes.
